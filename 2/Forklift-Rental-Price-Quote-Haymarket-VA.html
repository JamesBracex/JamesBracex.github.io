<p>Looking to rent material handling equipment in Phoenix? These forklifts are known for what their name indicates, their ability to lift loads at a high altitude.

<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material.

<p>20. 20 Final Rule  OSHA published the final rule for Powered Industrial Truck Operator Training on December 1, 1998.

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.
