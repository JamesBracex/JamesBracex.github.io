<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts require specialized training for operators is so important. The global forklift market has had a resurgence in the last two years but constant R&D, particularly in electric industrial vehicles and smart equipment, is essential, says Bob Wang, marketing director for Chinese manufacturer Hangcha.

<p>By control, by type, by load capacity, by end use industry and by region, to offer insights on the global Pallet Trucks market.

<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
