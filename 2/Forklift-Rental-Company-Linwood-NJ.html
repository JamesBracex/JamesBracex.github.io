<p>In addition to rentals, they also sell new and used equipment. You shouldn't ever buy forklifts that haven't had a Thorough Examinations test done, and you shouldn't purchase from a forklift sales dealer who doesn't know the ins and outs of lifting equipment. Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>
