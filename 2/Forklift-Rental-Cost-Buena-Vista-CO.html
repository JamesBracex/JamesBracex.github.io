We are exporter and has created a benchmark in the industry as a trusted manufacturer of hand pallet truck wheels. Regardless of the brand name, you should expect to find an engine capable of at least 74 to 78 hp on the lower end (straight mast forklifts) and up to 142 hp on the high end (encompassing telehandlers with extended reach capability).</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv.

From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>

<p>Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. First and foremost, it is important to understand the different types of lift kits.

<p>Powered industrial trucks can either be ridden by the operator or controlled by a walking operator. Generally, the smallest capacity cushion available, the 3,000 lb. is a light-duty truck ideal for warehouses and production lines. A lifted truck has its suspension raised and may have its engine modified to be louder, creating a true white trash experience. Constructed with either internal combustion engines or electric motors, reach trucks come in three main types: straddle reach trucks, standup reach trucks or double deep reach trucks.</p>
<p>Shall be located with the center of gravity centered 10 inches above the compressed operator's seat for sit-down trucks and centered 40 inches above the operator's platform for stand-up trucks. For trucks with tilting masts, the mast should be vertical as defined in Test #OP1 or at full rearward tilt, whichever is less stable. The pump ''top-of-stroke'' hydraulic fluid bypass minimizes stress on the system when the load is raised to maximum lift height.</p>
