We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb.

With the installation of a suspension lift, however, you can get a lot greater clearance. Mono Tube shocks with reservoir cylinder are constructed with off-road attitude and performance in mind. All terrain forklifts allow you to work in places where traditional forklifts cannot go. Rough terrain environments don't have to slow you down with Access Hire's range of all-terrain forklifts that offer greater maneuverability and keep the machine moving in the roughest of applications.</p>
<p>Counterbalance forklifts require specialized training for operators is so important.

Simply click on the forklift make and model you are interested in for pricing.</p>
<p>Wang says that Hangcha will continue to invest in rough-terrain R&D, particularly in developing equipment with more tonnage and configurations. Rough terrain poses additional threats and risks to the operators of forklifts. However, suspension lift kits let the truck owners lift their truck as high as they want. They have been renting out equipment for over 50 years.</p>
