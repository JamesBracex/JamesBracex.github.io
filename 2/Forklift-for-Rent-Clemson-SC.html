<p>Powered by energy efficient AC motors, the BT Reflex R-series and E-series of reach trucks are best suited to forklift applications involving high lifting with heavy loads. The latest family of low level order picking trucks from Toyota Material Handling is the BT Optio L-series. We're here to let you know what sets lifted trucks apart from other pickups on the road - it's more than just the style and the ride height.</p>
<p>It is used for material handling inside warehouses. Although there are several different ways in which trucks can be lifted, most methods fall into one of two categories: body lifts and suspension lifts. Body lift kits give your tires more clearance while retaining factory suspension alignment and geometry. You'll also want bigger tires and may also add a ladder to make it easier to get in. Wheels and tires come in many sizes, and you'll choose the ones that will customize your pickup for its intended use or the look you're seeking.</p>
<p>Just like with tires, wheels are also rated to carry a load, and most ratings max out at a specific tire size. Loads may fall or forklifts can easily be turned over tilting moderate loads. This involves driving the pallet jack throughout the warehouse, collecting different products on the order sheet, and safely getting out of the warehouse to load the orders onto a truck or other shipping vehicle.</p>

<p>The machine known as a stockpicker is an electric forklift truck specifically designed for filling individual customer orders which require piece-part or case picking, rather than full pallets or unit loads. Body lifts can increase the height of a truck by up to three inches and can allow for larger tires on the truck.
