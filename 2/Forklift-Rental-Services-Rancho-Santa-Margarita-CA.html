Improperly installed lift kits will make for a rougher ride at best, and will be a tremendous safety hazard at worst.

<p>The configurable Raymond 4750 4-Wheel Sit-Down Counterbalanced Forklift, well-known for its operator-friendly, open-mast” visibility, industry-leading ergonomics, and superior maintainability offers new features focused on better productivity, lower long-time costs, and enhanced driver comfort.
