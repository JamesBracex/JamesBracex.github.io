With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 30 feet in the air. Backed by our proven support network, Crown's internal combustion forklifts are ready to handle the tough assignments. Our exclusive lifted models make these professional-grade trucks even more impressive and capable.</p>

If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

They are outfitted with an open operator window in order to lift operators up to warehouse racks and carry individual units of inventory.

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
