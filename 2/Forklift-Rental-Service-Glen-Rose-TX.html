Forklift (F) driver licence endorsement, to drive a forklift on public roads. Place empty truck on initially level platform in a position such that the centerline of the truck is perpendicular to the axis of tilting of the platform, and with the rear wheels placed in their least stable position.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these rough terrain forklifts double as workhorses in the bush here in Australia.

Similar to a reach truck, the electric variety is only for indoor use.</p>
