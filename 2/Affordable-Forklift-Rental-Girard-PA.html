Large tires and elevated suspension equal higher ground clearance and mean these trucks are better able to handle all kinds of road conditions. Counterbalanced Stackers contain no outriggers and loads (1,500 - 4,000 lbs) are counterbalanced using the overall length of the unit, plus battery weight.</p>
<p>Owning your own fleet of forklifts means you need to spend time and money maintaining them. Four fixed-fork order pickers are ideally suited for picking bulky, oversized items or where extended platforms and industrial carts are used in place of pallets.
