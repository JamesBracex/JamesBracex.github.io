<h2>Forklift Truck Safety in - Never Lose Focus  Spring Hill </h2>
<p>Our AC Orderpicker trucks use fewer amps per cycle, so you'll save on batteries, chargers and downtime. First and foremost, it is important to understand the different types of lift kits. We are the leading and largest supplier of Hydraulic Pallet Truck in North India. Some SP Series models feature a 36-volt battery, which enables common batteries and chargers to be used across your lift truck fleet to optimise battery performance and shift life.</p>

<p>3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity of the truck.</p>

The nine-model P-Series RT forklift range includes units with rated lift capacities from 5,000 to 30,000 pounds (24-inch load center), with two-, three-, and four-section mast configurations. Single-double forks - forks that in the closed position allow movement of a single pallet or platform but when separated, turn into a set of double forks that allow carrying two pallets side by side.</p>
