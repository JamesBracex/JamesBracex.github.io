<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>Spinner knobs must not be attached to steering handwheels of trucks not originally equipped with such, without approval of of the safety department.

<p>What you need to do: Take a practical test where the forklift is driven around a suitable course and the operator will be required to move and stack various loads, the test will also include one to one verbal questioning.

Beginning mechanics may be surprised by the complexity of lifting a truck, particularly if the added height exceeds three inches.</p>
