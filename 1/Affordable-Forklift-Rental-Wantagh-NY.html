<h2>Powered Pallet Truck Wantagh</h2>
<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch.

Guided very narrow aisle order picking truck - counterbalance type Order Picking Truck similar to the guided very narrow aisle truck, except that the operator and the controls which operate the machine are in a cage welded to the mast.</p>
