<p>We are offering Premium quality Heavy & Medium Load capacity hydraulic Hand Pallet truck. It is the highest capacity stockpicker in the line, handling heavy palletized loads at heights up to 366 inches. You may also wish to consult with a custom truck body modifications expert for advice as to which types of vehicles will best meet your individual needs as well. This is why the aftermarket hardware can range from a minor lift kit to a comprehensive decked out vehicle.</p>
<p>If you do decide to go ahead and lift your truck, take extra care when operating it to ensure safety, and check everything underneath regularly for wear and tear to prevent and accelerated damage that may occur. However, the term rough terrain‚Äù does not imply that the forklift can be safely operated on every conceivable type of terrain. If you work in a small warehouse or need lift trucks for short runs, you can never go wrong with using electric motor hand trucks.</p>

Our professional, capable staff can help you choose the best truck for your needs, and we provide comprehensive support for our lines as well as almost every other make of lift truck on the market. Fork lifts are often used to unload materials from trucks, ships, and other large containers used in shipping and distribution.</p>
<p>As many models in our fleet feature four wheel drive, these machines are ideal to work outside carrying out heavy duty operations. Today many business owners are meeting the tasks of material movement with the help of these hand pallet trucks. Courtesy Chevrolet does our lifted trucks in house so you know you are getting a great deal and a quality job done.</p>

<p>Do not exceed the load limit of any type of powered industrial truck, especially a forklift. Create sales material to present to customers. In the Guru, when referring to overall width for class 2 & 3 trucks, overall width refers to the width of the power unit, not the outriggers. Rent equipment online to access exclusive web rates on all your rentals. Be sure you are selecting the right forklift for your intended application and weight loads.</p>
<p>If you have concerns about lifted trucks and you just want something from the factory that is great for going off-road, then either of these models is a great choice. Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>Not all forks are designed to lift pallets. For independent movement, lifting and placement of discrete loads throughout a facility, a variety of motorized lift trucks or forklifts can be used. If your company has an accident or injury with a forklift, OSHA will investigate and request training records.
