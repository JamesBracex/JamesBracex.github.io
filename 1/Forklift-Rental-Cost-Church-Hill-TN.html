<p>Report damaged or excessively worn pallet jacks. Choose a jack pallet scale from METTLER TOLEDO that will withstand regularly heavy industrial use. The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>
<p>Ideal for use in warehouses with vertical racking, Electric order pickers are available in either ride-on or walk-behind units. The type of tires you choose for your forklift greatly depends on the type of forklift you purchase and the driving environment.
