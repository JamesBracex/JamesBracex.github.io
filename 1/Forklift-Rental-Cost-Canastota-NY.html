<p>This practical training course is designed for existing fork lift truck operators who need to transfer their experience and skills towards the effective use of 4 Way Directional Reach trucks.

These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>

For individuals who do exclusively on-road driving and no hauling, the only noticeable benefit is the lifted line of sight and boosted aesthetic.
