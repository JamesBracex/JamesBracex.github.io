<p>We offer our customers access to both Factory New as well as Pre-Owned forklift trucks. At Granite Industrial Trucks we are ready to meet the needs of your company today.

We proudly offer Unicarrier, Hyundai, Baoli, Flexi, JLG, and Linde forklifts to meet your preference.</p>
<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>These IC forklifts are ideal for manufacturing plants and construction sites, where operators need versatility to handle multiple tasks and rugged reliability to navigate rough terrain, unpredictable weather and heavy loads. Toyota, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc., Crown Equipment Corporation are the top players in Forklift Trucks Market, due to their business strategies adhering to uplift the market growth.</p>

As previously mentioned, customers often want two primary kinds of lift kits. If not, a dealer that offers a range of rough terrain forklifts will enable you to try out a number of different options to see how they stack up against your particular needs.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>
<p>Come check out our online catalog and contact us today for all your materials handling equipment needs. From hand pallet trucks to electric rider pallet trucks, Crown offers a lift truck model for every pallet-handling application. Linde reach trucks help the driver with appropriate displays and assistance systems. With the added mass, your lifted vehicle will consume more fuel than it would otherwise.</p>
