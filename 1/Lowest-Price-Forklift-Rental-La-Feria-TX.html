<p>Product-line features: Omega covers all bases with its vertical-mast forklift offering. The nine-model P-Series RT forklift range includes units with rated lift capacities from 5,000 to 30,000 pounds (24-inch load center), with two-, three-, and four-section mast configurations.

<p>Trucks are pushing such boundaries with lift kits these days that it's almost getting ridiculous to see guys actually climb into them. The smaller design and increased maneuverability of narrow aisle forklifts allow them to reach tight areas and readily respond to unexpected hazards effectively. Meanwhile, Crown introduced a new 2-stage TL mast , commonly referred to as a Truckers Mast,” for its Crown FC 5200 Series counterbalance forklifts and the pneumatic and cushion tire models of the Crown C-5 Series industrial forklifts.</p>
