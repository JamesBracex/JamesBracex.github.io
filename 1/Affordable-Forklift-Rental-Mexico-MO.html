<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks.

Most rental companies use Toyota forklift models due to their reputation for safety and performance.</p>
<h2>Linde Lift Trucks Mexico</h2>
<p>On an F-150, one needs about a 4" lift to put on 35" diameter tires which is really the minimum for off road use here. Drivers in the market for a lifted truck need to perform an exhaustive inspection of the vehicle just like they would with any other pre-owned automobile. Browse through the vast selection of machines that have recently been added to our inventory.</p>
<p>Be sure the load is centered and the forks are completely under the load before lifting. Use these machines to tackle residential or commercial landscaping jobs. 2. Three-Wheel Counterbalance - These forklifts feature three wheels as opposed to four in their counterbalance forerunners. Compare that to any other body style of any car or truck from the ‘90s and it looks outdated and ugly.</p>
