<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers.

In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>
<p>3300-4500 mm Duplex or Triplex clear-view mast options available, to give you flexibility in customising your forklift for the job at hand. Crazy lift kits and cab stretching isn't just for light duty trucks. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident, because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck.</p>
