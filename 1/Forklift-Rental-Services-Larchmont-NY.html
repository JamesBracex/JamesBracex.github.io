In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

This will determine the kind of forklift needed to be able to maneuver through the space in which the truck is working.</p>
