Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>In many jurisdictions, it is illegal to alter or remove the nameplate without the permission of the forklift manufacturer. Whatever the case for your team, BlueLine Rentals has you covered.
