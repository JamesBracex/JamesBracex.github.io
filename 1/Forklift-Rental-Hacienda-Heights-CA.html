<p>Forklift is a small industrial vehicle, having a power operated forked platform attached at the front that can be raised and lowered for insertion under a cargo to lift or move it. Forklifts serve the needs of various industries including warehouses and other large storage facilities. In the United States, approximately one person is killed in a forklift accident every 3 days on average. Therefore, the driving experience behind the wheel of cheap used lifted trucks for sale is unlike anything else.
