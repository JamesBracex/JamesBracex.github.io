It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Shifting Supplies: Whether or not your supplies are palletized, you can shift them around with a rough terrain forklift. 158 Rule: The width of one tire will be the maximum distance from the edge of the truck while on any elevated dock, platform, freight car or truck.
