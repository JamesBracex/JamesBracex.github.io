There are so many things to consider when adding or replacing your used forklift equipment. Today, rough-terrain lifts have become the preferred forklift in agriculture.

A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
