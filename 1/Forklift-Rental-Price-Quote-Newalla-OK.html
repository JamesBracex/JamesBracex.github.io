<p>SCA Performance RAM trucks are some of the most powerful and performance-ready lifted trucks in the industry. This Motorised pallet truck is used in several industries for lifting purposes and due to its long functional life. However, the deaths of nearly 100 workers and 20,000 serious injuries that occur each year show that a forklift can be dangerous. Many advantages exist for using reach trucks. From reach forklifts to warehouse forklifts or rough terrain lifts - you can rely on our top-tier material handling equipment.</p>
<p>Reality: the higher a heavy load is lifted, the less safe a forklift becomes. When it comes to forklift sales, it's important to find a reliable dealer who you can trust to provide a value-for-money solution. Manual pallet jacks have a capacity of about 5500 lbs. The scale of materials transported and lifts used varies greatly depending on the type of industry in question.</p>

<p>Puma Lift Trucks Pvt Ltd is committed to sell the safest and the most efficient material handling equipments, by continually improving on the product, resources & technical capabilities.

<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>Increase your buying power: Besides enjoying an upfront saving, you'll also be able to buy two used forklifts with the same price of purchasing a new forklift. When people think of forklifts, they usually imagine the small vehicle with two forks on the front that's used for lifting pallets. For many people, the I'm on top of the world” feeling that comes with driving a lifted truck is enough to warrant buying one.</p>
<p>Moreover, the demand for the electric lift truck is witnessed majorly across the North America region and is also projected to grow in the same propaganda for the forecast period. In either case, a repair can be difficult if the forklift is stranded on rough terrain. Extendable fork: An extra long fork makes it possible for a narrow aisle forklift double stack pallets, one in front of the other.</p>
