<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Parts & Service - Our forklift parts and service departments are ready at a moments notice and can repair any brand of equipment in your fleet. Every rental truck is prepped by a Raymond certified technician and quality inspected by our shop foreman to make sure that each piece of equipment is ready to work when it reaches your facility. When you need to move materials, shift supplies, or store objects on a job site, a rough terrain forklift can do the job.</p>
<h2>Industrial Pallet Racks Salem </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for these tests, a truck shall not overturn when the platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 14 per cent slope for loaded truck (Test #N5), and a 14 percent or 18 percent slope for unloaded truck (Test #N5A), depending on whether the truck has single rear-wheel drive (or brake) or dual rear-wheel drive (or brakes), respectively.</p>
<p>3-wheel lifts - used for pallet storage and other minor” tasks, this type of lift has a max load capacity of about 4,800 pounds. Pallet jacks from Grainger provide leverage to help you lift heavy pallets full of inventory or materials in the warehouse, on the loading dock or at the jobsite. The test load shall be equivalent to an unrestrained homogeneous cube the dimensions of which are twice the test load center dimension and the weight of which is equal to the rated capacity of the truck.</p>
<h2>Used Pallet Jack Salem</h2>
<p>We also have a generous selection of forklifts and material handling units from other leading brands, including Motrec, Terex, and Columbia. Rent diesel or LP-gas forklift or rent a specialized material handling forklift, such as a truck-mounted forklift or piggyback truck. If your company needs a forklift, but your financial manager cringes at the expense of buying one, it's probably time to consider alternative options.</p>
<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet. As already mentioned, choosing a forklift with the right handling capacity is therefore essential. Forklifts come in a variety of shapes and sizes to do various jobs. You'll often see these forklifts traveling down the highway on the back of semi-truck trailers.</p>
<p>Available in both manual and electric operated versions, pallet trucks come in different variants to suit desired applications. The load limit of the lift truck decreases as the load centre is raised. Your solution: a high-capacity electric forklift. If the truck is originally equipped with front end attachments, the truck nameplate shall also be marked to identify the attachments and show the approximate weight of the truck and attachment combination and capacity of the truck and attachment combination at maximum elevation of the load engaging means with load laterally centered.</p>
<p>You will get in-depth instruction on how to operate a forklift on rougher-than-normal terrains. We provide top notch personnel doing a top notch job to keep your forklift equipment in top notchshape. Unlike a piece of machinery purchased over the Internet, professional forklift dealers specialize in pairing industries with the appropriate machinery — easily matching your business process with a forklift that meets your requirements.</p>

As a result of the flip-up driver platform and Click-2-Creep, these powered pallet trucks are ideal for working in confined areas and for loading and unloading lorries.</p>
<p>RT forklift manufacturers—and there are more than you might think, some with surprisingly broad product lines—are pursuing ongoing refinement of their machines. Also known as a straight mast forklift, the rough terrain forklift is designed specifically for outdoor job sites, especially on uneven surfaces. Ensure loads are stacked evenly on the forks before moving the pallet jack.</p>
<p>We also operate three trucks for parts collection in Johannesburg and share the use of a warehouse facility in Jet Park for these conditions. For example a panto-graph reach forklift utilizes a scissor mechanism, allowing it to reach into racking with either a single or double reaching design. On the other hand, Europe is projected to witness significant growth in the global forklift trucks market.</p>
