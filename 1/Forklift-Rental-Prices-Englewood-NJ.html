<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features). In the past most order picking jobs were carried out on ground level to increase the productivity, while stock was replenished to the bottom layer with reach & fork trucks. A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90'). Check to make sure that the pallet jack is not on the cross wood of the skid, front wheels must be on the floor. The pallet trucks may be manual or battery-powered.

Teletrucks, a new type of forklift, have an extending mast that is connected to a boom instead of a straight mast, giving them a wider range of motion. All rough terrain forklifts have a backrest that keeps the load in place. Ask the seller whether the forklift for sale is in usable condition, that the forks, mast, back rest, seat, chain and tires are undamaged, and if it has been involved in any accidents.</p>
